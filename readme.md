1. List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators
	Arithmetic Operators: +, -, /, *,  %;
	Assignment Operators: =;
	Comparison Operators: >, <, ==, ===;
	Logical Operators: &&, !, ||;
	Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>;

2. For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples:

	Arithmetic Operators:
	
		let a, b, sum, mult;
			sum = a + b;
			mult = a * b;

	Assignment Operators:

		let num = 5;

	Comparison Operators:

		let a, b;

			if(a>b){
				console.log("a is greater than b");
			}

			if(a==b>){
				console.log("b is equal to a");
			}

	Logical Operators:

		let a = true, b = false;
			console.log(a || b); //return true
			console.log(a && b); //return false

	Bitwise Operators

		let x = 5 & 1;  //return 1
		let x = 5 | 1;  //return 5


4. The result when the program is executed is:
	1, 8, 15
